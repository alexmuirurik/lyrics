                "O for a thousand tongues to sing, My great Redeemer's praise, The glories of my God and King, The triumphs of His grace!",
                "My gracious Master and my God, Assist me to proclaim, To spread through all the earth abroad The honors of Thy name.",
                "Jesus, the name that charms our fears, That bids our sorrows cease; 'Tis music in the sinner's ears, 'Tis life and health and peace.",

                "He speaks, and, listening to His voice, New life the dead receive, The mournful, broken hearts rejoice, The humble poor believe.",
                "Hear Him, ye deaf, His praise, ye dumb, Your loosened tongues employ; Ye blind, behold your Savior come, And leap, ye lame, for joy!",

                "The earth with its store of wonders untold, Almighty, Thy power hath founded of old; Hath stablished it fast by a changeless decree, And round it hath cast, like a mantle, the sea.",
                "Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, it shines in the light; It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.",
                "Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, In Thee do we trust, nor find Thee to fail; Thy mercies, how tender, how firm to the end, Our Maker, Defender, Redeemer, and Friend."
